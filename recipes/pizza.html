    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, olive oil, salt, white sugar and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a stiff dough has formed.</li>
        <li>Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat grill to high heat.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. Flip dough over and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove from grill and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread desired toppings over crust and return to grill for 10 to 15 minutes, or until well cooked and toppings are bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
